This is the screen recoring of the Trex in action!

I developed an interactive T-Rex game inspired by the "No Internet" game using JavaScript on the platform p5.js. The game features a dynamic desert environment where the T-Rex navigates through obstacles which is cacti. The cacti and the clouds are spawned randomly. The ground, clouds and cacti each have their own 'velocity', creating a realistic movement pattern. I implemented 'lifetime' to ensure obstacles are removed once they exit the frame, optimizing performance and preventing errors. The game includes a score counter for real-time tracking, and upon collision with an obstacle, a "Game Over" screen triggers, with a restart option via a button. This project utilizes core programming concepts like 'spawning', 'velocity manipulation', and 'lifetime management' to create a smooth, immersive gaming experience.
